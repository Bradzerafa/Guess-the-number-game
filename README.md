## NOTE:

    - This project is based on a tutorial: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course
    - UI provided by the tutorial and functionality developed by me.

        - Check that the number input is between 1 - 20. [COMPLETE]
        - If correct then saves the high score and changes UI.
        - If Incorrect deducts 1 point from score. [COMPLETE]
    - Clicking the again button:
        - Hides random number and generates new random number.
        - Clears number input box.
        - Resets score back to 20.
